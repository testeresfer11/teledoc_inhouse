As students ourselves, we struggled to find a space where learning felt natural, social, and truly supportive. Tutors were expensive, school resources felt limited, and online forums were either overwhelming or unhelpful. So, we built Edupalz; a free, global learning community where students connect, collaborate, and succeed together. Because education should never be a solo journey. It should be a movement.</p>"
